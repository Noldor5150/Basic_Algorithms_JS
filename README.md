## JavaScript Tasks

### Implement basic algorithm that will take in one Number value and return ‘Even’, ’Odd’ depending on which case it is. If provided value is not a number, you should return NaN.

### Implement algorithm that takes in String as a value and returns new String where each character is separated by -, and each char is repeated times of its index value in original string.

### Implement algorithm that takes in two parameters Array and String. Return filtered Array. String will define type of data that has to be left in the resulting Array.ExamplemyFilter([1, 2, ‘a’, 3, ‘c’, ‘d’], ‘number’) // rsult: [1, 2, 3];

### Create algorithm that takes in Array of numbers as Strings. Like this: [ ’10’, ‘5’, ‘0’ ]Return result as Array of Number type values;

### Implement algorithm named ‘pluck’. Input:- Array of Objects- String that defines property key name of the objectAs a result you have to return Array of the values of that key of Object from original Array.Example:const arr = [ { name: ‘Jon’, age: 15 }, { name: ‘Marry’, age: 12 } ];pluck(arr, ‘age’); // result: [15, 12];

### You have list of geese: geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];Implement algorithm that takes in Array and returns Array with geese removed from the Array;
